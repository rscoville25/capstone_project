# Untitled Game
A 3d beat-em-up style game built in Godot
## Resources Used
- **Godot**: The game engine used to build the project. I chose it because learning a new language (C++ or C#) would be too much to finish within the time I'm given. It's also a bit more user friendly than Unreal Engine and I don't like Unity.
  - https://godotengine.org/
- **Blender**: For 3d modeling and animation organization. The main character model was created by me. I used a couple of add-ons to have better compatibilty with Godot and generally save me a lot of headache.
  - **Godot Game Tools**: Add-on for blender that applies multiple animations to one 3d model and exports it for compatibilty for Godot

  - https://www.blender.org/
- **Adobe Mixamo**: Premade animations made by Adobe that look better than anything I could do. Has almost everything I could have wanted to animate

- And of course, random Youtube tutorials helped me with any question I had regarding how certain thing worked 

## Known Bugs
- Some animations playing when the're not supposed to
  - Player Character can get locked into the stun animation when not stunned
- GUI quirks to iron out
- Loading a save gives $1000 no matter what and 1xp on top of what was saved
